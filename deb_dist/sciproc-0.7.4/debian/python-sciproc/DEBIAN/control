 Sciproc in experimental stage provides tools to select, edit, convert scientific (observed, model-generated)
 data. It needs Numpy. It's very experimental, as some functions aren't tested or only tested in 'idealised
 cases', so please be careful.  Please let me know if you would like to contribute. Currently selection
 from 1D data by coordinates or certain timestep and applying a function repeatedly on a
 multidimensional matrix is implemented. However selecting, interpolating and editing procedures for
 multidimensional data is planned in the near future.  You might want to use it if you have have any
 observational data and you want to select a period, make a selection with a certain timestep or make
 an interpolation. The aim is to make an addition to the cdo climate data operators with python power
 (see also ncdftools). It should be working with normal numpy data. However, if you want to process
 netcdf-files, we recommend to use the ncdftools interface which acutally uses sciproc. Typical usage
 often looks like this::
 .
     #!/usr/bin/env python
 .
     from numpy import *
